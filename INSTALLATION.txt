To install SugarCRM you need to have a web server (Apache and IIS have been tested), PHP 4 configured, and MySQL installed and configured.
We also rely on the GD graphics library 2.0 or later for php to be configured.

Create a new Database in MySQL for your installation.
Uncompress our source code in your web application folder and launch a browser to index.php.  
Fill in all the questions, and you will have a new installation.

If you would like some sample data to play with, check the generate seed data option during the installation.

If you are deploying this system, it is recommended that you remove the install.php file when you are done to prevent someone from changing the settings.
